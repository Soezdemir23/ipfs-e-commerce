# ipfs-e-commerce
E-Commerce based on ipfs as a back-end.
A WIP
------------------------------------
## How do I run it?
+ Install IPFS and Node
+ Then clone the repository
+ Then in your directory, open the terminal and `enter npm install`
+ Then, `node app.js` into your terminal
+ Go to localhost:3000
+ Enter any mailaddress and watch the terminal for the storage and retirieval of the value.

--------------------------------------
What's currently on my agenda:
Understand Backend programming better so I can learn to understand ipfs better and apply the principles on his new system.
