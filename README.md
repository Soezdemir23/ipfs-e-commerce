# ipfs-e-commerce
E-Commerce based on ipfs as a back-end.
A WIP
------------------------------------
How do I run it?
Install IPFS, Node
Then clone the repository
Then in your directory, open the terminal and `enter npm install`
Then, `node app.js`
Go to localhost:3000
Enter any mailaddress and watch the terminal for the storage and retirieval of the value.

--------------------------------------
What's currently on my agenda:
Understand Backend programming better so I can learn to understand ipfs better and apply the principles on his new system.
